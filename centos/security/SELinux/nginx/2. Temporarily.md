# Temporarily Disabling SELinux for NGINX
To temporarily disable SELinux restrictions for the httpd_t context, so that NGINX can perform all the same operations as in nonâ€‘SELinux OSs, assign the httpd_t context to the permissive domain. See the next section for details.

# semanage permissive -a httpd_t
