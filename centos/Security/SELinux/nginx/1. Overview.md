# Overview of SELinux
SELinux is enabled by default on modern RHEL and CentOS servers. Each operating system object (process, file descriptor, file, etc.) is labeled with an SELinux context that defines the permissions and operations the object can perform. In RHEL 6.6/CentOS 6.6 and later, NGINX is labeled with the httpd_t context:
```
# ps auZ | grep nginx
```
```
unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 3234 ? Ss 0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx \
                                                -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 3236 ? Ss 0:00 nginx: worker process
```
The httpd_t context permits NGINX to listen on common web server ports, to access configuration files in /etc/nginx, and to access content in the standard docroot location (/usr/share/nginx). It does not permit many other operations, such as proxying to upstream locations or communicating with other processes through sockets.
