Changing SELinux Modes
SELinux can be run in enforcing, permissive, or disabled modes (also referred to as domains). Before you make an NGINX configuration change that might breach the default (strict) permissions, you can change SELinux from enforcing to permissive mode, in your test environment (if available) or production environment. In permissive mode, SELinux permits all operations, but logs operations that would have breached the security policy in enforcing mode.

To add httpd_t to the list of permissive domains, run this command:
```
# semanage permissive -a httpd_t
```
To delete httpd_t from the list of permissive domains, run:
```
# semanage permissive -d httpd_t
```
To set the mode globally to permissive, run:
```
# setenforce 0
```
To set the mode globally to enforcing, run:
```
# setenforce 1
```
