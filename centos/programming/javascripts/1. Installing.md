We will install the latest LTS release of Node.js, on the app server.

SSH to your app server using the regular, non-root user with sudo privileges.

On the app server, let’s use curl to download the NodeSource RPM Repository configuration file:
```
curl -L -o nodesource_setup.sh https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_10.x
``` 
CURL will use the HTTPS protocol to download the setup script to your server, with the output including information relevant to the download:
```
Output
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 11109  100 11109    0     0  70128      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 70757
```
Next, you should inspect the script’s contents. The following command will open the NodeSource setup script in your servers console, which you can then cross-reference with the NodeSource setup script (from the NodeSource Distributions Github repository) to confirm the script that downloaded properly:
```
vi nodesource_setup.sh
``` 
Once satisfied with the file, exit vi by typing :q to quit and return to the command line.

Now let’s run the setup script to install the NodeSource RPM Repository. This will enable us to access NodeSource’s repository from within the yum package manager:
```
sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh
``` 
The script outputs information on the setup for our reference:
```
Output
## Installing the NodeSource Node.js 10.x repo...

## Inspecting system...

+ rpm -q --whatprovides redhat-release || rpm -q --whatprovides centos-release || rpm -q --whatprovides cloudlinux-release || rpm -q --whatprovides sl-release
+ uname -m

## Confirming "el7-x86_64" is supported...

+ curl -sLf -o /dev/null 'https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_10.x/el/7/x86_64/nodesource-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm'

## Downloading release setup RPM...

+ mktemp
+ curl -sL -o '/tmp/tmp.2aCcULVx8n' 'https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_10.x/el/7/x86_64/nodesource-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm'

## Installing release setup RPM...

+ rpm -i --nosignature --force '/tmp/tmp.2aCcULVx8n'

## Cleaning up...

+ rm -f '/tmp/tmp.2aCcULVx8n'

## Checking for existing installations...

+ rpm -qa 'node|npm' | grep -v nodesource

## Run `sudo yum install -y nodejs` to install Node.js 10.x and npm.
## You may also need development tools to build native addons:
     sudo yum install gcc-c++ make
## To install the Yarn package manager, run:
     curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
     sudo yum install yarn
```
Before installing Node.js it is important to clean all the cached information from yum. Clearing the cache will ensure that yum uses the network connection to get Node.js from our new NodeSource Repository (which will prevent any potential conflicts caused by outdated packages):
```
sudo yum clean all
``` 
Next we will download and make usable all the metadata for the currently enabled yum repos. This will ensure that our yum queries are completed as quickly as possible:
```
sudo yum makecache fast
``` 
To compile and install native add-ons from npm we also need to install build tools:
```
sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make
``` 
Now we can install the latest release of the Node.js package:
```
sudo yum install -y nodejs
``` 
Verify that Node is installed by checking its version with this command:
```
node -v
``` 
Your output will show the version number you’re running:
```
Output
v10.16.3
```
The Node.js runtime is now installed, and ready to run an application. Let’s write a Node.js application.
